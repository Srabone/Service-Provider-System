# Service Provider System
The "Service Provider System" is a group project that utilizes PHP for server-side scripting to handle database operations and server interactions. HTML is employed to structure the web pages and present content to users, while CSS is used for styling and layout. JavaScript enhances user interactivity, providing form validation and dynamic content updates. AJAX enables asynchronous communication with the server, allowing for seamless data retrieval and updates without page reloads. JSON format facilitates data exchange between the server and client, ensuring efficient data transmission. Additionally, jQuery is utilized to simplify DOM manipulation and event handling, enhancing the overall user experience.
